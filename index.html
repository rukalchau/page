            <h2>補習－Tutorials</h2>
            <p>I provide comprehensive math tutorials tailored to secondary school students who are looking to enhance
                their
                understanding and excel in their mathematics studies. With a deep passion for mathematics and a strong
                commitment to educational excellence, I am here to support students in their academic journey.</p>

            <p>My tutoring services are designed to cater to a wide range of math topics covered in secondary school
                curricula, including algebra, geometry, trigonometry, calculus, and more. Whether you're struggling with
                a
                specific concept or seeking to strengthen your overall math skills, I'm here to help you build a solid

                adaptable and student-centric. I work closely with each student to identify their strengths and
                weaknesses,
                allowing me to tailor my lessons to their individual requirements. Whether you're a visual learner who
                benefits
                from graphical explanations, a hands-on learner who thrives through practical examples, or someone who
                simply
                needs a patient and supportive tutor to answer questions and provide guidance, I'm here to accommodate
                your
                learning style.</p>

            <p>My goal is not only to improve your mathematical skills but also to boost your confidence in the subject.
                I
                believe that with the right guidance and support, any student can overcome math-related challenges and
                excel in
                their studies. I provide a welcoming and encouraging learning environment where you can feel comfortable
                asking
                questions, making mistakes, and growing as a math student.</p>

            <p>If you or your child could benefit from extra help with math, please don't hesitate to reach out. I am
                here to
                provide you with the tools and knowledge you need to succeed in your secondary school mathematics
                studies.
                Together, we can work towards achieving your academic goals and building a strong mathematical
                foundation for
                the future.</p>

            <h2>Courses</h2>
            <p>I offer comprehensive programming and machine learning courses that are specifically designed for
                teenagers who
                have a keen interest in the exciting fields of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI). In
                today's
                technology-driven world, understanding the fundamentals of coding and AI is not only a valuable skill
                but also a
                gateway to countless opportunities.</p>
            <p>My courses are structured to provide a solid foundation in programming, with a strong emphasis on Python.
                Python is an excellent starting point, known for its simplicity and versatility, making it a perfect
                choice for
                beginners. In addition to Python, I introduce students to micro:bit, a user-friendly and hands-on
                platform that
                allows them to explore physical computing. Micro:bit is a great way for students to apply their
                programming
                knowledge to create interactive and tangible projects, which can be a highly motivating and engaging
                aspect of
                learning.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I incorporate Scratch, a visual programming language, into my courses. Scratch is an ideal tool
                for
                teenagers as it offers a creative and playful approach to coding, allowing students to build their
                programming
                skills through interactive and entertaining projects. It's a great way to ignite a passion for coding
                and
                computational thinking.</p>
            <p>With my background in mathematics, I am well-equipped to provide students with the intuitive
                understanding of
                the mathematical principles that underpin computer science and AI. This is crucial because mathematics
                is the
                language of these fields, and a solid grasp of mathematical concepts can significantly enhance a
                student's
                ability to comprehend and excel in programming and AI.</p>
            <p>My courses are not just about teaching code but also fostering problem-solving skills, logical thinking,
                and
                creativity. As students progress, they will have the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of
                machine
                learning, a subfield of AI that powers many of today's technological advancements. By demystifying
                machine
                learning concepts and providing hands-on experience, I aim to prepare students for the AI-driven future
                and
                empower them to be creators and innovators in this field.</p>
            <p>If you or your teenager is interested in exploring the world of computer science and AI, I encourage you
                to get
                in touch with me to learn more about the courses I offer. Together, we can embark on a journey of
                discovery,
                learning, and growth in these exciting and ever-evolving fields.</p>
