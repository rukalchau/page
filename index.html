            <h2>Courses</h2>
            <p>I offer comprehensive programming and machine learning courses that are specifically designed for
                teenagers who
                have a keen interest in the exciting fields of computer science and artificial intelligence (AI). In
                today's
                technology-driven world, understanding the fundamentals of coding and AI is not only a valuable skill
                but also a
                gateway to countless opportunities.</p>
            <p>My courses are structured to provide a solid foundation in programming, with a strong emphasis on Python.
                Python is an excellent starting point, known for its simplicity and versatility, making it a perfect
                choice for
                beginners. In addition to Python, I introduce students to micro:bit, a user-friendly and hands-on
                platform that
                allows them to explore physical computing. Micro:bit is a great way for students to apply their
                programming
                knowledge to create interactive and tangible projects, which can be a highly motivating and engaging
                aspect of
                learning.</p>
            <p>Moreover, I incorporate Scratch, a visual programming language, into my courses. Scratch is an ideal tool
                for
                teenagers as it offers a creative and playful approach to coding, allowing students to build their
                programming
                skills through interactive and entertaining projects. It's a great way to ignite a passion for coding
                and
                computational thinking.</p>
            <p>With my background in mathematics, I am well-equipped to provide students with the intuitive
                understanding of
                the mathematical principles that underpin computer science and AI. This is crucial because mathematics
                is the
                language of these fields, and a solid grasp of mathematical concepts can significantly enhance a
                student's
                ability to comprehend and excel in programming and AI.</p>
            <p>My courses are not just about teaching code but also fostering problem-solving skills, logical thinking,
                and
                creativity. As students progress, they will have the opportunity to delve into the fascinating world of
                machine
                learning, a subfield of AI that powers many of today's technological advancements. By demystifying
                machine
                learning concepts and providing hands-on experience, I aim to prepare students for the AI-driven future
                and
                empower them to be creators and innovators in this field.</p>
            <p>If you or your teenager is interested in exploring the world of computer science and AI, I encourage you
                to get
                in touch with me to learn more about the courses I offer. Together, we can embark on a journey of
                discovery,
                learning, and growth in these exciting and ever-evolving fields.</p>
